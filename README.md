# Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System (Prototype)

This project is a **basic prototype** of a face-recognition-based system built using Python.  
At the current stage, the application provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)** with a **live webcam feed**, serving as the foundation for future face recognition features.

The project is developed for academic purposes and demonstrates the integration of **Tkinter**, **OpenCV**, and **Pillow**.
